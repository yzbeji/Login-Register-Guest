# Login-Register-Guest V1.0
 This project was made in C# and SQL to learn the basics of these two programming languages. I really liked this project so I will continue to update it more in the future with new features. Besides the Objected Oriented Programming Language of C# and basic commands of SQL, I used BCrypt-Hashing to store the passwords to add more security to the database. Also, when you try to register an account, you'll receive on your e-mail a 4-digit verification code to be sure that you are human :). The project is free to use and also I am open to opinions.
