# Login-Register-Guest V1.0
 This project was made in C# and SQL to learn the basics of these two programming languages. I really liked this project so I will continue to update it more in the future with new features. Besides the Objected Oriented Programming Language of C# and basic commands of SQL, I used BCrypt-Hashing to store the passwords to add more security to the database. The asynchronous method to establish connection to the database was to not interrupt your process, it will disturb you only if the connection was not made.Also, when you try to register an account, you'll receive on your e-mail a 4-digit verification code to be sure that you are human :). The project is free to use and also I am open to opinions. Also, if you are on Mac, you'll need Docker and Azure Data Studio or Visual Studio code and of course internet connection to make it work.
